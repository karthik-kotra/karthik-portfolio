    <p id="lol">Hey, I'm Karthik Kotra, currently a second-year BTech student 
        in Computer Science Engineering. I have a passion for listening to music
         and love traveling to new places. In my free time, you'll often find me 
         playing volleyball, table tennis, or badminton.
         I enjoy making new friends and exploring different cultures. Nice to meet you!

            I completed my 10th grade at Sri Chaitanya School, achieving a perfect score of 10 grade points out of 10, which reflects my dedication and academic excellence. Following this, I pursued my 12th grade at Excellencia Junior College, where I scored 94% in my intermediate state board exams, demonstrating my consistent performance and commitment to my studies.<br><br>

My passion for coding and technology guided me to choose Computer Science Engineering as my major. I decided to join GITAM College for my BTech, influenced by the offer of a 25% scholarship, which recognized my academic achievements and provided an excellent opportunity to further my education in a reputable institution.<br><br>

In my first year at GITAM, I maintained a strong academic record, scoring a 9.16 SGPA in my first semester and a 9.26 SGPA in my second semester. This sums up to an overall CGPA of 9.17 for my first year, highlighting my consistent performance and dedication to my studies.<br><br>

            I don't have any official projects yet, as this is my very <br>
            first website. Currently, I'm working on data structures and algorithms.<br>
             I will update 
            this section once I start working on and completing projects.<br>
